## Comparing Feature Extraction Algorithms for SNP Classification 
Dr. Garrett Dancik | CSC 450 01 | Ian Valeta 

### Brief Description: 
I will be replicating the results of the the 2023 Research Article Entitled "*Conservation genomics reveals low connectivity among populations of threatened roseate terns (Sterna dougallii) in the Atlantic Basin*" written by Paige A. Byerly, R. Terry Chesser, Robert C. Fleischer, Nancy McInerney, Natalia A. S. Przelomska & Paul L. Leberg. After replicating the results of this study I will compare the LASSO and SCAD algorithms to perform a feature selection task.

#### Objective: 
The goal of this project is to learn how to classify multiple organisms by population based on anomalies within the DNA. SNPs

#### Background: 
SNPs stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms. They are simply areas within the DNA that are different in multiple organisms

```Example

Organism 1: ...ACTATAGAG...
Organism 2: ...ACTATAGTG...
                      ^
                     SNP
